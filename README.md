# **Space Quiz - 2024 STEAM Olympics Hackathon**
**About**: *this was my winning submission for the 2024 STEAM Olympics Hackathon*

## Hackathon Project Description:

Develop a text-based quiz game where users answer questions about space exploration, astronomy, and famous astronauts. At the end of the quiz, the program should state the user score and the option to restart the game. If the user selects to restart the game, they should be prompted with new sets of question or quetions in a different order.

## Code Overview:

I created a webpage that quizes the user on questions about space. Each iteration of the game, 10 questions from a random set of questions would be chosen to quiz to user. It was a multiple choice quiz and after the user completed the 10 questions they would get to see their score as well as the play again button being enabled
